            <li>
                Non- Personally Identifiable Information Collected. When You visit this Website, we may use a web server and web server log to automatically track and collect certain non-personally identifiable information, such as Your Internet protocol (IP) address, pages viewed, access times and other relevant statistics. We also may use common information collection tools like “cookies,” which are small pieces of data placed on the visitor’s computer hard drive, to help this Website recognize unique users and monitor general traffic and site use trends. Cookies help us to understand how You use and navigate this Website and, in turn, how we can make this Website more user friendly. With most Internet browsers, You can erase or reject cookies, or set Your browser to prompt a warning whenever a cookie is sent. </li>
                <li>	Personally Identifiable Information Collected. From time to time, this Website may provide opportunities for You to submit personally identifiable information in order to register an account, purchase services, post information, or receive information You have requested, such as by registering to receive services announcements, updates and notifications.

            <h4 class="h4 custom-h4 text-uppercase">How We Use Your Information.</h4>
            <p class="cont-terms">
                The information collected via this Website is used as generally described above, e.g., to help improve and administer this Website, provide information, and/or fulfill requests made by You. Please note that we may share some of Your personally identifiable information with potential employers, other users, or our affiliates or unaffiliated third parties who help us provide such services or satisfy such requests, or with unaffiliated third parties with whom we have or enter into a business relationship. However, you may choose to make some of your personally identifiable information private. The personal information that you provide to us may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of our Terms of Use and freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying to us any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part. You can withdraw or modify your consent to our collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, by changing your account settings or your profile or by closing your accounts. We also may disclose Your personally identifiable information (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity. We reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale, merger or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use any personally identifiable information you have provided to us in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy. However, we do not rent, sell or trade any personally identifiable information and will not share Your personally identifiable information with any third party except as set forth above.
            </p>
            <p class="cont-terms"><strong>If You provide us with personally identifiable information, You have the following rights with respect to that personally identifiable information:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-policy">
                <li>To review the personally identifiable information that You have supplied to us;</li>
                <li>To request that we correct any errors, outdated information, or omissions in the personally identifiable information that You have supplied to us;</li>
                <li>To request that Your personally identifiable information be deleted from our records; and</li>
                <li>To opt out of being solicited by this Website. </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="cont-terms">
                If You request that Your personally identifiable information be deleted from our records, there may be a brief delay in our processing that request while we verify that the request is valid and originates from You as opposed to an unauthorized third party. If You request that Your personally identifiable information be deleted, we reserve the right to terminate and/or limit Your access to the Website.</p>

                <p class="cont-terms">To exercise any of these rights, please contact us as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h4 class="h4 custom-h4 text-uppercase">Mobile Applications.</h4>

                <p class="cont-terms">Without limiting the generality of this Privacy Policy, in addition to information gathered through the Website, FirstSynch may obtain information through an application (“Mobile Application”) that You download and run on Your mobile device(s) (“Devices”). The Mobile Application may obtain information from, or access data stored on, Your Devices to provide services related to the Mobile Application. For example, the Mobile Application may: access a camera on a Your Device to enable You to upload photographs to us; access the call history on Your Device to enable You to upload that information; access calendar information on Your Device to enable You to match meeting attendees with Your contacts; access the geographic location of Your Device to enable You to identify contacts submitted who are nearby; or access contact information on Your Device to enable You to sync contact information between the information that is stored on Your Device and the information that is submitted to the Website. Information obtained to provide Mobile Application services may include information obtained in preparation for anticipated updates to those services. The Mobile Application may transmit information to and from Devices to provide the Mobile Application services.</p>

                <p class="cont-terms">Mobile Applications may provide us with information related to Your use of the Mobile Application services, information regarding Your computer systems, and information regarding Your interaction with the Mobile Application, which we may use to provide and improve the Mobile Application services. For example, all actions taken in the Mobile Application may be logged, along with associated information (such as the time of day when each action was taken). We may also share anonymous data about these actions with third party providers of analytics services. In addition, if You download the Mobile Application after clicking on a third-party mobile advertisement for the Mobile Application or for FirstSynch, the third-party advertiser may provide us with certain information, such as Your Device identification information, which we may use to track the performance of its advertising campaigns.</p>
                <h4 class="h4 custom-h4 text-uppercase">Opting-Out.</h4>

Additionally, most Internet browsers also offer their own security features that enable end users to control how their transmissions are protected. Please remember, however, that any personally identifiable information You send to us via the Internet is subject to the risk of unlawful interception by third parties, and that no method of safeguarding information is 100% secure. Further, please note that, in our discretion, aggregated information that contains no personally identifiable information may not be treated as private or confidential. </p>

If an Affiliated Company Website has its own privacy policy, the provisions of that policy will control, to the extent of any conflict with this Privacy Policy. </p>

If there is a material change in the personally identifiable information we collect or our other privacy practices, we will indicate on the Website that our privacy practices have changed and provide a link to the new policy. In the event we make a material change to how we use Your personally identifiable information, we will provide You with an opportunity to opt-out of such new or different uses. You are responsible for periodically reviewing the Website and this Privacy Policy to check for any updates or changes.
